    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This has turned out to be my wife's absolute favorite recipe for filet mignon with mushrooms.
      The original called for about a third of the liquid, but the sauce is so good that she always
      complained about not having enough to dip bread in. So the liquid measurements are tripled
      here from the original. By <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/6120008">Brian Wren</a>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 slices bacon</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon and ¾ teaspoon unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>½ clove garlic, mashed to a paste</li>
      <li>3 medium (blank)s white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>½ pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons and ½ teaspoon bourbon</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons and ½ teaspoon water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves</li>
      <li>1 steaks filet mignon steaks, about 1 inch thick</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place bacon in an 8-inch cast iron skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
        occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
        Pour off excess fat from the skillet. Crumble bacon and reserve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook garlic in the hot butter,
        stirring, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add mushrooms, salt, and pepper; cook over medium
        heat, stirring, until liquid from mushrooms starts to evaporate, 5 to 7 minutes. Add bourbon
        and boil until nearly evaporated. Stir in water, lemon juice, and Worcestershire. Boil until
        sauce is thickened slightly. Transfer sauce to a small saucepan and stir in reserved bacon
        and parsley. Keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>Pat steaks dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining butter in a skillet over medium-high heat until foam begins to subside. Sear
        steaks for 4 minutes; turn over and sear, 3 to 3 1/2 minutes for medium-rare. Divide between
        2 plates and spoon sauce over them.
